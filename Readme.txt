Hi,
  Here are four ".java" files, one txt file which is the resource file made by the program. In case of any command line compile problems, I provide the
fan.jar(Runable) for you to run and test.
  I completed this project by using javaFX with TableView,There are three basic functions : Add a record, Change a record, Delete a record.
You can get any selected item by double click the items in the TableView.Do not forget to select the comboBox for state,date and etc.Welcome
testing any input for the text field, the program will give you reasonable response.
	Thank you and have a good day.
